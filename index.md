# Welcome to Mind & Matter

The brain is perhaps the most fascinating object in the known universe. Here, I explore the intricate workings of the mind through the lens of neuroscience and psychology.

## What I Write About

**Neuroscience** — How neurons fire, networks form, and consciousness emerges from billions of interconnected cells

**Psychology** — The patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior that make us uniquely human

**The Mind-Brain Connection** — Bridging the gap between biological mechanisms and lived experience
