Hello fellow science enthusiasts! I'm Shivam, and this is where I share my passion for the natural world and the tools we use to explore it.

## What You'll Find Here

**ðŸ§¬ Biology**: From molecular mechanisms to ecological systems, exploring life at every scale

**ðŸŒŸ Astronomy**: Journey through the cosmos, from our solar system to distant galaxies

**ðŸ’» Scientific Programming**: Just to project the visuals of living organisms, Stars, galaxies, black hole, just to understand it better, maybe using OpenGL and other visualization library
