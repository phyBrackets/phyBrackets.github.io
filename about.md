# About Me

I'm Shivam, fascinated by the intersection of neuroscience and psychology. Through this blog, I share insights about how our brains work and why we think, feel, and behave the way we do.

## My Interests

I'm particularly drawn to understanding consciousness, memory formation, the neuroscience of emotions, and how psychological theories connect to biological realities. I believe that science is most powerful when it helps us understand ourselves and improve human wellbeing. Other than that I am a Software Engineer, I believe in Computation, but hardly believe if consciousness is computable.

## Why This Blog?

The brain sciences are advancing rapidly, with new discoveries reshaping our understanding of the mind almost daily. I write here to explore these developments, break down complex concepts, and share the wonder of discovering how we work from the inside out.
